# Image-Analysis
(a) Perform the following logical operations on two images:  AND, OR, NOT.      
This Repository contains all the necessary techniques that are used in the image analysis model. i.e. Feature extraction, Filtering, Masking, noise removal, and many more these codes were Written in MATLAB 2015 Develop a GUI which performs the following functions: 
(a) Perform the following logical operations on two images: AND, OR, NOT.
(b) Use these logic functions to extract meaningful objects from an image using different mask shapes as studied in the class.

Develop a GUI with input parameters (Image and mask) from the user to performs following operations:
(a)Mean Filtering to perform smoothing and noise removal;
(b)Median Filtering to remove salt and pepper noise.
(c)Enhancement filtering:
(d)For image sharpness;
(e)For edge detection.

Develop a GUI which performs following functions:
(a)Matlab code to implement a Hough transform for finding lines in an image given through GUI.(User enter the line angles of interest and the Minimum number of pixels per line)
You are required to
